# 🔍 Valid8 Licensing Model: Team vs Individual - Complete Explanation

## The Key Difference: Per-Seat Individual Licenses with Volume Discounts

**TL;DR**: There's no "team vs individual" pricing. Every developer needs their own individual license, but teams get automatic volume discounts as they scale.

## 📊 How Pricing Actually Works

### Individual Developer (1 seat)
- **Cost**: $15/user/month (Starter tier)
- **What you get**: 1 license bound to 1 machine
- **Use case**: Solo developer or very small team

### Small Team (2-10 seats)
- **Cost**: $15/user/month each
- **Total for 5 developers**: $75/month
- **No volume discount yet**

### Growing Team (11-50 seats) - **PROFESSIONAL TIER**
- **Cost**: $12/user/month each (20% discount)
- **Total for 25 developers**: $300/month
- **Savings**: $75/month vs individual pricing

### Large Team (51-200 seats) - **BUSINESS TIER**
- **Cost**: $10/user/month each (33% discount)
- **Total for 100 developers**: $1,000/month
- **Savings**: $500/month vs individual pricing

### Enterprise Team (200+ seats) - **ENTERPRISE TIER**
- **Cost**: $8/user/month each (47% discount)
- **Total for 500 developers**: $4,000/month
- **Savings**: $3,500/month vs individual pricing

**Savings**: $45/month (20% discount)

### Example 2: Scale-up with 75 developers
**Without volume discount**: 75 × $15 = $1,125/month
**With volume discount**: 75 × $10 = $750/month
**Savings**: $375/month (33% discount)

### Example 3: Large enterprise with 300 developers
**Without volume discount**: 300 × $15 = $4,500/month

## 🤔 Why Individual Licenses Instead of Team Accounts?

### Security & Compliance
- **Hardware binding**: Each license tied to specific machine fingerprint
- **No shared credentials**: Eliminates security risks
- **Audit trail**: Individual accountability for license usage
- **Compliance ready**: Meets enterprise security requirements

### Technical Reasons
- **Machine-specific**: AI models and scanning optimized per environment
- **Concurrent usage**: Multiple team members can work simultaneously
- **Resource allocation**: Each machine gets dedicated processing resources
- **Offline capability**: Each license works independently

### Business Model Benefits
- **Natural scaling**: Teams automatically qualify for discounts as they grow
- **Predictable pricing**: No complex team tiers to manage
- **Fair pricing**: Each developer pays for value they receive
- **Growth incentive**: Teams save money as they expand
